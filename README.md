# S.T.A.L.K.E.R. animated cursor theme for linux mint
I have been using the [windows version](https://gamebanana.com/tools/1522 "Stalker windows icon page") for so many years and i always wanted it to work on my Linux Mint too. After some googling, i mashed up these icons with [WinSur-Dark Icon Theme ](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/WinSur-dark-cursors "WinSur-Dark Icon Theme page").

## installation:
 * Extract to 
    ```
      /home/<USERNAME>/.icons
    ```
* Open Settings-Themes and change the icon setting accordingly.

## Demo:
